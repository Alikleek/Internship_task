for the server of internal.example.com we check for the ip of the server from /etc/resolve.conf
after using the nslookup command to search dns 8.8.8.8 it is found that the ip of the server exists, meaning the ip is valid on the global dns 
we use $curl http://127.0.0.53 to check port 80, if it outputs then it's open 
we use $curl https://127.0.0.53 to check port 443, if it outputs then it's open

Possible issue:
1-the firewall might be blocking access
2-the dns might have a syntax error on the name 
3-local host file might have wrong ip 

Possible solutions:
1- add the ports 80 and 443 to the firewall allow list using $sudo ufw allow 80,443/tcp
2-  change hostname of server to match the dns 
3- create file /etc/hosts to have the current hostname and ip to override bad dns name
4- use resolvectl to add the server $resolvectl set-dns eth0 8.8.8.8
